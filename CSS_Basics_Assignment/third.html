        <h4>Relax</h4>
        <p>I read the news today, oh boy<br>
            About a lucky man who made the grade<br>
            And though the news was rather sad<br>
            Well, I just had to laugh<br>
            I saw the photograph<br>
            He blew his mind out in a car<br>
            He didn't notice that the lights had changed<br>
            A crowd of people stood and stared<br>
            They'd seen his face before<br>
            Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords<br>
            I saw a film today, oh boy<br>
            The English Army had just won the war<br>
            A crowd of people turned away<br>
            But I just had to look<br>
            Having read the book
